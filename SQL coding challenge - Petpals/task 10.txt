Q.Write an SQL query that retrieves the total donation amount for each month and year (e.g., January 2023) 
  from the "Donations" table. The result should include the month-year and the corresponding total donation amount. 
  Ensure that the query handles cases where no donations were made in a specific month-year.

->
mysql> select DATE_FORMAT(DonationDate,'%M %Y'),SUM(DonationAmount) as TOTALAMOUNT
    -> from donations
    -> group by DATE_FORMAT(DonationDate,'%M %Y');
